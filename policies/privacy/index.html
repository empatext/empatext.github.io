**Lean On Me Privacy Policy**

> Lean On Me Peer Support, Inc. (“**Lean On Me**", “**we**” or
> “**us**”), has created an online and SMS platform (collectively
> referred to as "**Services**") to provide a peer support network for
> college students in need of mental health support.
>
> Lean On Me is committed to respecting your privacy. This **Privacy
> Policy** covers how we collect, use, and treat information that you
> may provide through our Services. Our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
> apply to Peer Supporters, Clients, and Site Visitors (collectively,
> “**Users**”). Unless otherwise provided, all provisions of this
> Privacy Policy apply to all Users. Capitalized terms are defined in
> context or as provided in our Terms of Use.
>
> **1. Your Consent**. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By
> using our Services, you are acknowledging that you have read and
> understood this Privacy Policy and agree to be legally bound by it.
>
> **2. The Types Of Information You May Provide**. Information you may
> provide or that we may collect from you while participating in our
> Services falls into two broad categories: (i) Voluntary Information,
> and (ii) Information Automatically Collected. We use the term
> “**Voluntary Information**” to mean information that you provide when
> you are accessing our Services. “**Information Automatically
> Collected**” is information that we automatically collect, and may
> include statistical information concerning, for example, your use of
> our Services or the pages on our website that you visit most
> frequently.
>
> **3. Voluntary Information; Our Collection Of This Information**. You
> have the opportunity to provide us Voluntary Information as follows:
>
> **3.1 Clients Only Required to Provide Phone Number**. If you wish to
> become a Client of our Services, we only require that you provide your
> mobile phone number so that our Peer Supporters can communicate with
> you via text message. You may include personally identifiable
> information in your text messages with Peer Supporters, but you are
> not required to do so.
>
> **3.2 Registration Information for Peer Supporters.** In order to
> become a Peer Supporter, Lean On Me requires you to provide us with
> certain personally identifiable information, including your name,
> e-mail address, mobile phone number, and other related information.
> You may be required to submit additional information so that Lean On
> Me can evaluate your application.
>
> **3.3. Email Addresses**. You may wish to provide us with comments and
> feedback concerning the Services generally. By communicating with us
> for these purposes, you may provide us with your email address and
> other personally identifiable information.

> or other information to Users who have signed up for our email list.
> If you sign up for our email list, you must submit an email address to
> which we can send communications. After you have signed up for the
> email list, you will have the ability to opt out of receiving these
> communications as provided in Section 6 (Changing or Removing
> Information; Opting Out).

> **3.5 User** **Content.** By posting comments on any forums or other
> messages on the Services, you may provide us with your email address
> and other personally identifiable information contained in those
> comments or other submissions.
>
> **4.** **Information Automatically Collected.** Whenever you interact
> with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on
> our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP
> address, geolocation data, device identification, “Cookie”
> information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access
> our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are
> identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to
> recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and
> features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may
> be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent
> or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you
> from taking advantage of some of our features. 
>
> Our advertising partners (if any) may also transmit Cookies to your
> browser or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Services.
> Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or Services, a
> third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy
> Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we
> aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be
> aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your
> activities online even after you have left our Services, and those
> third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using
> your browser or device. 
>
> We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you
> might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to
> improve the Services – for example, this data can tell us how often
> users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that
> knowledge to make the Services helpful to as many users as possible.
>
> **5. We Do Not Disclose Information to Unaffiliated Third Parties;
> Limited Exceptions**. We do *not* disclose your information to
> unaffiliated third parties without your express consent, except in the
> following circumstances:
>
> **5.1. Service Vendors.** We may employ other companies to perform
> functions on our behalf, such as hosting or maintaining the Services,
> collecting information, processing payments, responding to and sending
> email, or other functions necessary to our business. We may need to
> share your information and conversations with these companies
> (collectively, "**Service Vendors**"). We provide Service Vendors with
> only information necessary to perform their functions, and we will not
> allow them to use your information for any other purpose.
>
> **5.2 Peer Supporters and Administrators.** If you are a Client, Peer
> Supporters that you interact with will be able to access the
> information that you include in your messages. We only allow Peer
> Supporters to use your information as necessary to provide the
> Services. Administrators from Lean On Me and your local chapter of
> Lean On Me may access copies of your conversation with Peer Supporters
> to the extent technically required for the provision of Services and
> also in order to advise Peer Supporters on best practices. Each
> conversation with a Peer Supporter will be saved for up to one month
> after the conversation ends.
>
> **5.3 Public Comments and Forums.** Please note that if you submit any
> Voluntary Information to a portion of the Services that is accessible
> by other Site Visitors, Clients and/or Peer Supporters, including an
> online forum or comment section, those other Site Visitors, Clients,
> and/or Peer Supporters will be able to see that Voluntary Information.
> Accordingly, only include information in such submissions that you are
> comfortable sharing with third parties.
>
> **5.4 Transfer to Professional Services**. If you are a Client and
> Lean On Me determines in its sole discretion that it cannot provide
> sufficient support services to you, Lean On Me reserves the right to
> transfer your saved conversations with Peer Supporters and relevant
> Volunteer Information (such as your telephone number and email
> address, if provided) to third-party support systems and/or emergency
> services.
>
> **5.5. Question of Harm.** We may reveal your information to
> attorneys, private investigator organizations or law enforcement
> agencies if we believe (a) that you are in risk of harm from another,
> or (b) that you are harming or interfering (or will harm or interfere)
> with yourself or others or violating (either intentionally or
> unintentionally) our Terms of Use or otherwise violating legal rights.
>
> **5.6. Legal.** Lean On Me will reveal your information to the extent
> we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law. If we receive
> legal process calling for the disclosure of your information we will
> attempt to notify you via the email address you supplied during
> registration (if applicable) within a reasonable amount of time before
> we respond to the request, unless such notification is not permitted.
>
> **5.7. Transfer of Services.** Lean On Me shall be entitled to
> transfer to a third party information it collects, including any
> personally identifiable information, in connection with a sale of all
> or substantially all of the assets of the entity responsible for the
> information under this Policy.
>
> **5.8 Our Affiliates.** We may choose to rely on and share information
> with companies closely related to us – our "**Affiliates**" - for
> certain purposes under this Privacy Policy. By "Affiliate," we mean an
> entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
> with Lean On Me, whether the control results from equity ownership,
> contract, overlapping management or otherwise. In this context,
> "control" means the ability to replace the officers or directors or
> otherwise materially influence or control management decisions. You
> agree that Lean On Me Affiliates will be entitled to enjoy our rights
> under this Policy and, in exchange, we agree that we will be
> responsible for our Affiliate's conduct under this Policy, if our
> Affiliate fails to comply with any resulting obligations. In any
> event, we ensure that our Affiliates agree to protect personally
> identifiable information in a manner no less protective of your
> interests than the protections set out in this Policy.

**5.10 De-Identified Information. **We may de-identify your personal
information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide
that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage
information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that
information from you), who may use such information to understand how
often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can
provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never
disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or
allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would
identify you as an individual person.

>
> **6.1. Opt-Out.** If you sign up to receive communications from us via
> our email list, we will provide you with the ability to decline -- or

> a communication. You will not be allowed to "opt–out" of formal

> leanonmeteam@gmail.com.
>
> Finally, if you request, we will remove your name and all other
> personally identifiable information that you have provided from our
> databases. It may be impossible to remove this information completely,
> due to backups and records of deletions. If you request deletion of
> your information, you will not be able to utilize associated features
> of the Services. You may not remove de-identified, anonymous, or
> aggregate data from our databases.
>
> **7. Security**. We have put in place security systems designed to
> prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of personally
> identifiable information you provide to us, and we take reasonable
> steps to secure and safeguard this information. This provision should
> not be construed in any way as giving business, legal, or other
> advice, or warranting as fail proof, the security of information
> provided by or submitted to Lean On Me. Due to the nature of Internet
> and text messaging communications and evolving technologies, we cannot
> provide, and disclaim, assurance that the information you provide us
> will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties
> who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorized access.
