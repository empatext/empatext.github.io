# Lean On Me Supporter Oath
## I pledge, as a Lean On Me Volunteer Peer Supporter:
- To act and converse in good faith (eg. responsibly, thoughtfully, empathetically, and with integrity).
- To describe myself to Lean On Me users accurately as a Volunteer Peer Supporter and to never indicate to a user that I am officially certified, licensed, or titled to provide medical advice, crisis response, or  emotional support.
- To appropriately refer users to available resources, per the Supporter Development Workshop in which I participated and in the interests of being as helpful    as possible, especially when I feel unsure of how to handle a given situation.
- To report misconduct and provide feedback whenever I detect issues with anything related to Lean On Me (eg. the system, users, supporters).
- To defend and respect usersâ€™ privacy and safety, especially in accordance with the Lean On Me Privacy Policy and Terms.
- To never disclose identifying information about myself to a Lean On Me user that I am matched with (talking to through the Lean On Me platform).
- To uphold the values of Lean On Me. 

I understand that any violation, in spirit or in letter, of any part of this Oath or relevant agreements, terms, values, guidelines, or otherwise explicit or    implied responsibilities of being a Peer Supporter are my sole responsibility, including any resultant consequences (eg. legal, financial, etc.) and/or    termination or suspension of my status as a Lean On Me Peer Supporter. 

I agree to indemnify and hold harmless Lean On Me from any liability, loss, or damage they may suffer as a result of claims, demands, costs, or judgments    against them arising out of the activities to be carried our pursuant to my obligations as a Peer Supporter. 

I hereby acknowledge by this Oath, for both my safety and the safety of users with whom I interact, that I agree to be bound by my Oath, by the Lean On Me Terms of Service, and by my genuine good will as a caring, loving human being. 

Effective: February 15, 2016
