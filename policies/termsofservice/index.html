> **Lean On Me Terms of Use**
>
> IF YOU ARE IN DANGER OR NEED EMERGENCY HELP, CALL 911 OR YOUR LOCAL
> AUTHORITIES. WHILE OUR PEER SUPPORTERS ARE THERE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT,
> THEY ARE NEITHER LICENSED THERAPISTS NOR DO THEY HAVE PROFESSIONAL
> CREDENTIALS. FOR OTHER CLARIFICATIONS ABOUT THE SCOPE OF OUR SERVICES,
> PLEASE SEE SECTIONS 11 THROUGH 13 OF THESE TERMS.
>
> Lean On Me Peer Support, Inc. (“**Lean On Me**", “**we**” or
> “**us**”), has created an online and SMS platform (collectively
> referred to as "**Services**") to provide a peer support network for
> college students in need of mental health support.
>
> To assist you in using our Services, and to ensure a clear
> understanding of the relationship arising from your use of the
> Services, we have created (i) these Terms of Use (the "**Terms**") and
> (ii) a **Privacy Policy**. Our Privacy Policy explains how we treat
> information you provide to us through our Services, and our Terms
> govern your use of the Services. Our Terms and Privacy Policy apply to
> both trained student supporters with registered accounts (each, a
> “**Peer Supporter**”), clients of Lean On Me’s Services
> (“**Clients**”) and any casual visitor to our Services who is not a
> Peer Supporter or Client (“**Site Visitors**”; and, together with Peer
> Supporters and Clients, “**Users**”).

Please read this document carefully before you access or use our
Services. By accessing the services, you agree to be bound by the Terms.

> **1. Your Agreement.** These Terms govern the use of our Services as
> well as any information, text, graphics, photos, or other materials
> uploaded, downloaded, or appearing on the Services (collectively
> referred to as “**Content**”) provided and managed by Lean On Me,
> (iii) your provision of information in connection with participating
> in our Services (“**User Content**”); and (iv) your use of information
> obtained through the use of the Services including reports,
> information, data, statistics, software, artwork, text, video, audio,
> pictures, content, trademarks, trade dress, and other intellectual
> property owned by Lean on Me or its licensors and made available to
> you through the Services.
>
> You may visit our website and application and review a range of
> information about Lean On Me and our Services without registering.
> However, to provide Services on behalf of Lean On Me as a Peer
> Supporter, you must register an account with Lean On Me. In order to
> access our Services as a Client, you must provide Lean On Me with your
> mobile telephone number.
>
> **2. Our Services: Overview.** Lean On Me provides a text messaging
> service that creates texting networks of support across university
> campuses by anonymously matching Clients with Peer Supporters. The
> messaging service is not intended to replace emergency hotlines and
> sends out a standardized message referring a Client to other support
> organizations if the matter is identified by the Peer Supporter as an
> emergency. If you are interested in becoming a Peer Supporter, please
> visit our website to learn how to apply.
>
> **2.1** All Peer Supporters are independent volunteers not employed or
> controlled by Lean On Me.
>
> **2.2** All Content, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted,
> is the sole responsibility of the individual who posts or transmits
> the Content. We may not monitor or control Content supplied to the
> Services by Users, and we are not responsible for any such Content.
> Any use or reliance on any Content or materials supplied via the
> Services or obtained by you through the Services is at your own risk.
>
> **2.3** We currently provide our Services for free, but please be
> aware that your carrier’s normal rates and fees, such as text
> messaging and data charges, will still apply.

**3. User Age Requirement.** The Services are intended for Users age 18
and older. In compliance with the requirements of Children’s Online
Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we do not collect any information from
any person under 13 years of age. If you are aged 13 years or younger,
you may not download or use our Services or access or provide any
Content. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you may be required

> Areas. You may access and view Site Visitor Areas for your personal
> and non-commercial use only, and you may not modify, copy, distribute,
> or otherwise use the Content available in these Site Visitor Areas.
>

    infringement claim;
